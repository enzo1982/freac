## Download
Pre-built packages for Windows, macOS, Linux and FreeBSD are available at [freac.org](https://freac.org/latest-snapshot/).

## Compiling
fre:ac depends on the [BoCA audio component framework](https://github.com/enzo1982/boca/) and the [smooth Class Library](https://github.com/enzo1982/smooth/). Please build and install those first.

Development packages for the following libraries need to be installed in order to build smooth, BoCA and fre:ac:

- For the smooth Class Library: libbz2, libcurl, libfribidi, libgtk+3.0, libjpeg, libxml2
- For the BoCA component framework: libcdio, libcdio-paranoia, libexpat, libpulse (Linux only), liburiparser
- For fre:ac itself: libudev (Linux only)

When the dependencies are met, run `make` followed by `sudo make install` for smooth, BoCA and fre:ac respectively.

You should then be able to run fre:ac using `/usr/local/bin/freac` and the command line interface using `/usr/local/bin/freaccmd`.
