BonkEnc version 0.8

BonkEnc is an encoder for various audio formats. It can
produce MP3, Ogg Vorbis, BONK, AAC and VQF files.

Requirements
------------

	- Windows NT/2000/XP, Windows 95/98/SE/ME
	- A 200MHz processor or better for playing BONK files
	- Winamp is required to play BONK files in Windows
	- You'll need properly installed ASPI drivers for CD ripping.

	Additional requirements for compiling the sources:

		- MinGW32 v1.0 or greater (http://mingw.sf.net/)
		- smooth v0.8.60.0 (http://smooth.sf.net/)
		- IOLib v5.x (http://iolib.sf.net/ - included with smooth)

	Additional optional software:

		- BladeEnc is used if installed (http://bladeenc.mp3.no)
		- FAAC is used if installed (http://faac.sf.net)
		- TwinVQ is used if installed (http://www.twinvq.org)

Problems
--------

	- There are the following restrictions on the input file format:

		- BonkEnc:
				- files must be 16 bit
		- BladeEnc:
				- files must be 16 bit at 32, 44.1 or 48kHz
		- LAME:
				- files must be 16 bit at standard rates (8, 11.025, 12, 16, 22.05, 24, 32, 44.1, 48kHz)
		- Ogg Vorbis:
				- files must be 16 bit, stereo
		- FAAC:
				- files must be 16 bit, stereo
		- TwinVQ:
				- files must be 16 bit, at 22.05kHz (24 and 32kBit) or 44.1kHz (48kBit)

	- Resampling is only supported with LAME. Input files must be at the desired output
	  sampling rate unless you are encoding with LAME.

Future plans
------------

	- extend the BONK format to support ID3V2 tags
	- extract artist and title from the filename and write ID3V2 or similar
	- input filters for BONK, AAC, VQF
	- support more audio formats (FLAC, MAC, ...)
	- allow expert settings for LAME (ATH, Temporal Masking, Psy-Models)
	- develop an IOLib-Filters based plugin system
	- add a command line interface to allow scripting
	- support more languages
	- cleanup the code
	- add CDDB support
