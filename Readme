Further codecs (e.g. Nero's HE-AAC encoder) can be used as external
plug-ins (see the manual for installation instructions).

fre:ac uses the CDRip library for audio ripping on Windows.
fre:ac uses the cdio library for audio ripping on macOS, Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD and NetBSD.
fre:ac uses the cdparanoia library for audio ripping on Linux, FreeBSD and OpenBSD.

Installation
------------

	fre:ac is distributed in two variants, an .exe file containing a setup wizard or alternatively
	a .zip archive that contains just the application without an installer.

	If you downloaded the .exe installer, simply run it and the setup wizard will guide you through
	the installation process creating start menu icons that will run fre:ac.

	If you downloaded the .zip package, please extract/move the contents to a location of your
	choice and run freac.exe to start fre:ac.
