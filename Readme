ripping and tag editing and converts the following audio formats:

	- MP3
		- using the LAME MP3 encoder		(http://lame.sourceforge.net/)
		- using the mpg123 decoder		(http://www.mpg123.de/)
		- using the MAD MP3 decoder		(http://www.underbit.com/)

	- MP4/M4A AAC
		- using the Core Audio AAC encoder	(http://www.apple.com/)
		- using the FAAC/FAAD2 codec		(http://www.audiocoding.com/)

	- Windows Media Audio				(http://www.microsoft.com/)

	- Xiph Foundation codecs
		- Opus					(http://www.opus-codec.org/)
		- Vorbis				(http://www.vorbis.com/)
		- Speex					(http://www.speex.org/)
		- FLAC					(http://flac.sourceforge.net/)

	- Apple Lossless (ALAC)
		- using the Core Audio ALAC encoder	(http://www.apple.com/)
		- using the libav ALAC encoder		(http://www.libav.org/)
		- using David Hammerton's ALAC decoder	(http://www.craz.net/)

	- Musepack					(http://www.musepack.net/)
	- WavPack					(http://www.wavpack.com/)
	- OptimFROG					(http://www.losslessaudio.org/)
	- Monkey's Audio				(http://www.monkeysaudio.com/)
	- TAK						(http://www.thbeck.de/)

	- various other formats
		- using the libsndfile library		(http://www.mega-nerd.com/)
		- using the libav codec library		(http://www.libav.org/)

Further codecs (e.g. Nero's HE-AAC encoder) can be used as external
plug-ins (see the manual for installation instructions).

fre:ac uses the CDRip library for audio ripping on Windows.
fre:ac uses the cdio library for audio ripping on macOS, Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD and NetBSD.
fre:ac uses the cdparanoia library for audio ripping on Linux, FreeBSD and OpenBSD.

Installation
------------

	fre:ac is distributed in two variants, an .exe file containing a setup wizard or alternatively
	a .zip archive that contains just the application without an installer.

	If you downloaded the .exe installer, simply run it and the setup wizard will guide you through
	the installation process creating start menu icons that will run fre:ac.

	If you downloaded the .zip package, please extract/move the contents to a location of your
	choice and run freac.exe to start fre:ac.
