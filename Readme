Known problems
--------------

	- There are the following restrictions on the input file format:

		- BladeEnc:
				- audio must be at 32, 44.1 or 48 kHz
		- FLAC:
				- the FLAC reference encoder is limited to a maximum sample resolution of 24 bit
		- LAME:
				- audio must be at standard rates (8, 11.025, 12, 16, 22.05, 24, 32, 44.1, 48 kHz),
				  can be converted by LAME
		- TwinVQ:
				- audio must be at 22.05 kHz (24 and 32 kBit) or 44.1 kHz (48 kBit)

	- Resampling is only supported with LAME. Input files must be at the desired output
	  sampling rate unless you are encoding with LAME.

	- fre:ac is currently limited to a maximum of 2 audio channels
