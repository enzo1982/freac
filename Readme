fre:ac version 1.1 CVS

fre:ac is a free and open source audio converter for various formats.
It reads MP3, MP4/M4A, AAC, Ogg Vorbis, Bonk, FLAC, WAV, AIF, AU and
VOC files and converts to MP3, MP4/M4A, AAC, Ogg Vorbis, Bonk, FLAC,
VQF or WAV.

fre:ac uses the CDRip Ripping Library for audio ripping.
fre:ac uses the FAAD2 AAC decoder for Advanced Audio decoding.

Requirements
------------

	- Windows NT/2000/XP/Vista/7, Windows 95/98/SE/ME, Wine v0.9.14+
	- 200 MHz CPU, 128 MB RAM, 50 MB free disk space

	Additional requirements for compiling the sources:

		- MinGW-GCC v4.0+ (http://www.mingw.org/) or MSVC v9.0
		- smooth v0.8.71.0 CVS (http://www.smooth-project.org/)

	Additional optional software:

		- Winamp plug-ins can be used if they are present in the 'plugins' directory

Known problems
--------------

	- There are the following restrictions on the input file format:

		- BladeEnc:
				- audio must be at 32, 44.1 or 48 kHz
		- FLAC:
				- the FLAC reference encoder is limited to a maximum sample resolution of 24 bit
		- LAME:
				- audio must be at standard rates (8, 11.025, 12, 16, 22.05, 24, 32, 44.1, 48 kHz),
				  can be converted by LAME
		- TwinVQ:
				- audio must be at 22.05 kHz (24 and 32 kBit) or 44.1 kHz (48 kBit)

	- Resampling is only supported with LAME. Input files must be at the desired output
	  sampling rate unless you are encoding with LAME.

	- fre:ac is currently limited to a maximum of 2 audio channels
