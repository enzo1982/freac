Installation
------------

	Windows:

		fre:ac is distributed in two variants, an .exe file containing a setup wizard or alternatively
		a .zip archive that contains just the application without an installer.

		If you downloaded the .exe installer, simply run it and the setup wizard will guide you through
		the installation process creating start menu icons that will run fre:ac.

		If you downloaded the .zip package, please extract/move the contents to a location of your
		choice and run freac.exe to start fre:ac.

	macOS:

		fre:ac is distributed as an Apple Disk Image (.dmg) file.

		To install it, open the .dmg image and drag the fre:ac application to a location of your choice
		like the desktop or the Applications folder. Then double click the application to start fre:ac.

		Alternatively, users of the package manager MacPorts (www.macports.org) may install fre:ac using
		the following command:

			sudo port install freac

	Linux:

		fre:ac is available as a Snap, Flatpak or AppImage package.

		The Snap and Flatpak versions can be found and installed from the respective app stores. Please
		note that these versions run in restriced environments and might offer limited functionality.

		The AppImage package must be marked as executable after downloading using the following command:

			chmod a+x freac*.AppImage

		The AppImage can then be executed to start fre:ac.

	FreeBSD:
