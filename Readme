				- audio must be at 8, 11.025, 12, 16, 22.05, 24, 32, 44.1, 48, 64, 88.2 or 96 kHz
			- LAME:
				- audio must be at 8, 11.025, 12, 16, 22.05, 24, 32, 44.1 or 48 kHz,
				  can be converted by LAME

		- Resampling is only supported with LAME. Input files must be at the desired output
		  sampling rate unless you are encoding with LAME.

		- fre:ac is currently limited to a maximum of 2 audio channels

	Windows specific problems:

		- There are the following restrictions on the input file format:

			- BladeEnc:
