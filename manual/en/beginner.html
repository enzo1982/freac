		<p>Download the latest version of fre:ac from
		  <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/bonkenc">SourceForge</a> or
		  from the <a href="https://www.freac.org/">fre:ac homepage</a>. Install
		  the program and start it. Now put an audio CD in your CD/DVD
		  drive. The CD tracks will usually show up automatically in the fre:ac main
		  window. If they do not, click the
		  "Add audio CD contents" button to add the tracks to the joblist.</p>
		<img style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" src="images/joblist_plain.png"/>
		<p>Since we do not want to have to manually enter names for the CDs
		  we can just query the freedb CD database online to
		  fill in the names for us. To do this we simply go to the
		  "Database" menu and hit "Query CDDB database". We should get a screen
		  that looks like this:</p>
		<img style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" src="images/query_cddb.png"/>
		<p>The program will automatically fill in track information:</p>
		<img style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" src="images/joblist_info.png"/>
		<p>Once that's done we should configure the general settings
		  for the program. Go to the "Options" menu and select "General settings". This will
		  display the following dialog:</p>
		<img style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" src="images/config_settings.png"/>
		<p>In the first screen we can set the encoder settings. fre:ac
		  defaults to using the LAME MP3 encoder. We will
		  be using it in this tutorial. Make sure the "Encode on the fly" option is checked.
		  Also set your output directory to where you want the encoded MP3s to go.
		  I've set this directory to my music directory.</p>
		<p>The file name pattern box is where you can set how the file names will
		  be formatted. I happen to like having mine in directories where the
		  album name and artist appear in the directory header and the filenames
		  will be tracks followed by their title. The corresponding file name pattern
		  is "<b>&lt;artist&gt; - &lt;album&gt;\&lt;track&gt; - &lt;title&gt;</b>". So in this case it will
		  end up with file names looking like these:</p>
		<img style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" src="images/explorer.png"/>
		<p>For the more advanced users there are many other settings which can
		  be modified to fit personal likings or requirements.</p>
		<p>We should now configure the LAME encoder so that we have decent MP3
		  output. Go to the "Options" menu and select "Configure selected encoder".</p>
		<img style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" src="images/configure_encoder.png"/>
		<p>You should get a screen similar to the one shown below.</p>
		<img style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" src="images/config_lame.png"/>
		<p>fre:ac comes with several different presets for the LAME
		  encoder. All of these just give different settings to the encoder
		  with various qualities. The higher the setting (e.g. "Extreme") the
		  more room the MP3s will take up on your hard drive but the better they
		  will sound. I prefer to use the custom settings and set qualities
		  individually. You can see those settings here. For now
		  let's leave the preset on Standard. Hit ok and we can select
		  which tracks we want to rip and encode.</p>
		<p>Now that we are back in the main screen we can select which tracks we want
		  to rip and encode. To the left of every track there is a little check box. The ones
		  that have an × in them are the ones that are marked for ripping and
		  encoding. Since I want to rip the whole CD I will leave all 5 checked
		  but if you only wanted one track you could uncheck all but that one.</p>
		<p>We can now hit the big play button which will start the encoding process.</p>
		<img style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" src="images/start_encoding.png"/>
		<p>The bottom of the window will start to show a progress bar:</p>
		<img style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" src="images/encoding.png"/>
		<p>As each song finishes, the joblist (where all the titles are displayed) will automatically remove any finished songs.</p>
		<p>Congratulations! You've just ripped and encoded your first CD with fre:ac!</p>
